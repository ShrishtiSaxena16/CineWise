# Movie-Recommendation-System
A movie recommendation system utilizes the collective preferences of a group of users to suggest movies to individuals.

Here I have used Collaborative Filtering which identifies similarities between users based on their past movie ratings and preferences. Analyzing these patterns helps the system to predict how a user might rate a movie they haven't seen yet.

Therefore, recommending films that align with their tastes.
